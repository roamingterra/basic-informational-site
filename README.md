# Basic Informational Site

This is a small project putting into practice basic Node.js.

The goals of this project were to;

- Create several html pages (home, about, contact, and a 404 page)
- Create a Node.js server that handles http requests and serves the appropriate html
- The server should serve the 404 page if the user manually types in a sub directory of the site
  that cannot be found
- Bonus: Add some JavaScript to handle, on the client-side, http requests when the user clicks on the home icon, or any of the navigation menu buttons
- Bonus: Add some css to make it look presentable

# Built with
